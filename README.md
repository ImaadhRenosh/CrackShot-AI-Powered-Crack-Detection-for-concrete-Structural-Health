## Overview
CrackShot is an AI-powered crack detection system designed to ensure the structural health of concrete structures. Crack detection holds vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, CrackShot aims to provide accurate and efficient crack detection solutions.

## Objective
- How to download and pre-process the Concrete dataset.
Crack detection has vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection. We aim to train a network to detect cracks, where images containing cracks are positive, and images without cracks are negative. This involves downloading the data, studying the dataset, and plotting a few images.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, numpy
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- numpy

## Installation & How to Run
To set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ImaadhRenosh/CrackShot-AI-Powered-Crack-Detection-for-concrete-Structural-Health.git
    cd CrackShot-AI-Powered-Crack-Detection-for-concrete-Structural-Health
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries using:
    ```python
    import os

    # Change to a stable directory
    os.chdir('/home')  # Adjust based on your environment

    # Install required libraries
    !pip install tensorflow --user
    !pip install opencv-python --user
    !pip install numpy --user

    # Verify installations
    import tensorflow as tf
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    print("Libraries installed successfully!")
    print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
    print("OpenCV version:", cv2.__version__)
    print("numpy version:", np.__version__)

    # Import Required Libraries
    import tensorflow.keras as keras
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Crack_Detection.ipynb`.
